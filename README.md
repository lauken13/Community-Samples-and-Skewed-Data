# Community-Samples-and-Skewed-Data
This repo contains the scripts used to run the simulations titled: "On the use of clinical scales in non-clinical populations: A discussion of the analysis of skewed responses" authored by Lauren Kennedy, Daniel Navarro, Amy Perfors and Nancy Briggs.

Two R Scripts are included: SimulationScript.R, FinalScript.R
Contains the functions only to be used -SimulationsScript.R Runs the simulations reported in the manuscript. Approximate run time is 72 hours on a single core. Because of this, we have included the data reported in the paper for convenience. This is included in -distributions_ex.Rdata, linear_single.predictor.Rdata, T_TestAlternatives.Rdata, linear_multiple.predictor.Rdata. To create the plots we used in the paper, please refer to the script -FinalScript.R

The pdfs are simply the plots produced, and are presented in the paper.
